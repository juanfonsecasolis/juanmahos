<h3>Description</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In my leisure time, I have developed an i386 toy OS called juanmaHOS. It is coded in C/C++ (MingW) and Assembly (Nasm). For the nonce is a single-user, single-task 32b OS, capable of playing sounds using the internal pc speaker, draw forms in the screen (squares, circles, rows, letters) and read keyboard inputs.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is inspired in the fiction movie of "Patlabor 1" directed by Mamoru Oshii". The idea was to replicate the OS's boot presentation: the squares turning and emerging up from the black button, the letters 'H','O' and 'S', the colors, the synchronization of the letters, the text messages, the password input: "e.hoba" and the "babel" red and white screen.<br />
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For the moment the juanmaHOS has been tested in IBM based machines using the Grub boot loader installed in a removable device like flash memory or a floppy. The usual procedure to load the OS is to restore a ".img" image file in a physical drive or copy the "kernel.bin" in a removable drive that already has been restored with that image.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the future would like to make faster the animations in the screen and add the capability of playing .wav files using the pc internal speaker.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: medium;">What it is good for?</span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As you can see in the next sections, juanmaHOS is not a desktop OS that can be used as Windows, Linux or ReactOS, but instead is a personal and rudimentary OS developed for learning and entertainment purposes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Please have fun!</p>
